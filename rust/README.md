# Epthos, a distributed backup system

> The cloud is somebody else's computer, why not choose your friend's?

## Epthos for normal users

- Your files are backed up as they get modified, without your intervention.
- Your files are stored with a person you trust, but even they can't see the content, including file names.

## Epthos for the paranoid

- Open-source.
- Continuous validation of the archives.
- Fallback ways of restoring data don't involve external dependencies.

## Current status

Under development, come back later :)
